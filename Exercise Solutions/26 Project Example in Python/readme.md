## Dataset

> The Data includes information about individual rides made
in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco
Bay area.
> We will try to explore what affects the Number of rides :


## Summary of Findings

> - we found that the day with high rides was Wednesday and then come after Monday and Tuesday. 
> - While Friday and Saturday were the less days which were expected.
> - We found that most people use the service were male.
> - We found that most people use the service are **Subscribers**
> - We found that most people use the services were in age between **25 Abd 40** , which was expected
> - We found that most ride durations were less than 10 min , which is expected for a bike ride
> - Most people use the service are young (less than 40 year old),mostly between 25-40 year old
> - Most rides are less than 10 minutes.
> - There is no clear indication that there is a  relation between member age and the duration of his/ride
> - There is no effect of gender in the distribution of the ride duration
> - The three gender types have nearly the same distribution.
> - Male may have more slightly less median and disruption of the other two types
> - That mean that male duration has slightly less in average of the other two types
> Although as we saw before that number of customer is only 9.5 % of all users , they are more distributed and have more average duration than the Subscribers that represents 90.5 %.
